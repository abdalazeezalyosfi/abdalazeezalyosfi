👋 Hi, I'm @abdalazeezalyosfi

👀 I'm interested in mobile app development, particularly with Flutter and native iOS (Swift). I enjoy building high-quality, user-friendly mobile apps that solve real-world problems.

🌱 I'm currently learning more advanced topics in Flutter and iOS development, such as state management, testing, and performance optimization. I'm also exploring emerging technologies like AR/VR and machine learning as they relate to mobile apps.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on interesting mobile app projects, whether it's developing new apps from scratch or contributing to existing open-source projects. I'm eager to work with other passionate developers and learn from their experiences.

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
